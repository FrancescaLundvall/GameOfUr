# The Royal Game of Ur

This two player board game comes from Ancient Mesopotamia and was extremely popular in ancient times.

It is a "race" type game where the two players compete to get all seven of their pieces off the board first.

Typically, three pyramidal dice are used with 2 "positive" corners and 2 "null" corners. This gives the total possible roll result as 3

I have taken the rules from the [Irving Finkel v. Tom Scott 2017 Rules](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/royal-ur-rules.htm?srsltid=AfmBOoo6QlxweiQLRuOJWrx_CzGTnTRkXtQ_8NjSnufVDV9ew_w6NprL) set as I personally find them the most fun. With these rules, games typically take 20 to 30 minutes.

## Rules
1. You may split your moves between pieces
2. You remove an opponent's piece by landing on it
3. You cannot land on your own piece
4. If you land on a rosette you must roll again
5. The first person to get all their pieces off the board wins
6. If you do not have any valid moves you must skip your turn
7. You cannot capture an opponent's piece when it is on the central rosette
8. You can only exit on an exact throw

## To run this program
- Install python and run `UrBoard.py` in your terminal

- To skip your turn, enter `s`
- The first player is always `player1`
- Piece names are case sensitive, `player1` pieces are always lower case, and `player2` pieces are always upper case
